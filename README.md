Rooftop Renegade Game:

Rooftop Renegade is a side scrolling endless runner game, where the objective is to achieve the highest possible score. The player must stay
atop the platforms as falling to the bottom of the screen results in death. After a certain period of time the background will change
reducing the platform visability and making the game overall harder.
